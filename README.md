# docker-compose-snippets

This is nothing but just a collection of docker-compose snippets for services i need to use often.

For example a new selfhosted project i need a mariadb container,or postgres, then i just copy/paste from the snippet and into the actual project.

Most of these have been set up to have working healthchecks and i use autoheal to check on that, automatically restart unhealthy containers and notify me.
